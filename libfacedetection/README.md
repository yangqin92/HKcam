# libfacedetection

This is a binary library for face detection and face landmark detection in images. 
The 32-bit and 64-bit dll files are provided.
To achieve better performance, the 64-bit dll is recommended.

examples/libfacedetect-example.cpp shows how to use the library.

* NVIDIA TK1 "4-Plus-1" 2.32GHz ARM quad-core Cortex-A15 CPU
* Multi-core parallelization is disabled.
* C programming language, and no SIMD instruction is used.

The dll cannot run on ARM. The library should be recompiled from source code for ARM compatibility. If you need the source code, a commercial license is needed.

Binary library for ARM
-------------
The binary evaluation library for ARM can be downloaded at https://github.com/OAID/YSQfastfd . The detection functions can only be called about 2000 times for evaluation.

Accuracy evaluation
-------------
FDDB: http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/fddb/index.html

![Evaluation on FDDB](https://github.com/ShiqiYu/libfacedetection/blob/master/FDDB-results-of-4functions.png "Evaluation on FDDB")

* scale=1.08
* minimal window size = 16
* the heights of the face rectangles are scaled to 1.2 to fit the ground truth data in FDDB.
